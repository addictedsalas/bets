# üèÄ Basketball Bet Tracker

Automated basketball betting opportunity tracker that monitors live games and alerts you when profitable betting opportunities arise during the 3rd quarter with ~7 minutes remaining.

## üéØ How It Works

1. **Monitors Live Games**: Tracks NBA, NCAA, WNBA, and EuroLeague games
2. **3rd Quarter Detection**: Identifies games in 3rd quarter with ~7 minutes left
3. **Calculation**: Uses your formula: `(Current Total Score) √∑ 0.75 = Projected Final Total`
4. **Edge Analysis**: Compares projected total vs FanDuel betting lines
5. **Alerts**: Sends Telegram notifications for opportunities with 10+ point edges
